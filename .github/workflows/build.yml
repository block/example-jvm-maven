# Runs on every commit. This is the main CI job; it runs in MacOS and Ubuntu environments which:
# * Build
# * Run tests
#
# In the Ubuntu environment only, to avoid double uploads from MacOS, it also:
# * Uploads Coverage reports to CodeCov
# * Publishes (deploys) to Block's SaaS Artifactory instance as version commit-$shortSHA-SNAPSHOT
#
# If triggered from workflow_dispatch, you may select a branch or tag to
# deploy as an internal "release" (or SNAPSHOT, depending upon the version in the POM)
# to Block's SaaS Artifactory instance by not specifying a version.
